# Control Flow

This file provides an overview of control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, exceptions, etc.) across the backend codebase, organized by file. Each section lists the types of constructs and representative code lines for reference.

---

## agent/api.py
- **if**: Used for response handling, data validation, and stream control (e.g. `if channel == response_channel and data == "new"`, `if isinstance(data, bytes)`)
- **elif/else**: Used for branching stream logic and error handling (e.g. `elif channel == control_channel ...`, `else:`)
- **for**: Used for iterating over responses, files, and tasks (e.g. `for response in new_responses:`)
- **try/except/finally**: Used for error handling in async operations and file uploads (e.g. `try: ... except Exception as e:`)
- **while**: Used for stream and task loops (e.g. `while not terminate_stream:`)
- **with**: Used for resource management (not shown in snippet but typical for file/network ops)

## agent/run.py
- **if**: Used for checking message types, status, and model logic (e.g. `if chunk.get('type') == 'assistant' ...`)
- **try/except**: Used for error handling in tool execution and streaming

## agent/tools/data_providers_tool.py
- **try/except**: Used for provider error handling

## agent/tools/sb_files_tool.py
- **if**: Used for file existence and preview logic (e.g. `if preview_url:`, `if self._file_exists(full_path):`)
- **try/except**: Used for file operation error handling

## agentpress/context_manager.py
- **if**: Used for checking response structure and token thresholds
- **try/except**: Used for LLM call error handling

## agentpress/response_processor.py
- **if**: Used for config checks, result parsing, and tool execution
- **try/except**: Used for response processing and cost calculation
- **else**: Used for fallback logic

## agentpress/thread_manager.py
- **if**: Used for result validation and auto-continue logic
- **try/except**: Used for thread management error handling
- **while**: Used for auto-continue loops

## sandbox/docker/browser_api.py
- **if**: Used for checking DOM and action results (e.g. `if delay_ms > 0:`)
- **elif/else**: Used for DOM navigation and attribute checks

## services/llm.py
- **if**: Used for type and model checks
- **try/except**: Used for LLM API and parameter handling
- **else**: Used for fallback logic

## tests/test_simple_tools.py
- **if**: Used for attribute checks on test objects
- **try/except**: Used for test error handling
- **else**: Used for test fallback logic

## utils/config.py
- **if/elif/else**: Used for environment variable type handling
- **try/except**: Used for configuration parsing
