# Backend Static Analysis Results

This folder contains the results of static analysis performed on the backend codebase. The analysis covers:

- **Dependencies:** Imported modules and packages
- **References:** Function and class usages
- **Types:** Type hints and annotations
- **Control Flow:** Loops, conditionals, and other control structures

Each section is organized for easy reference in future tasks.

---

- `dependencies.md`: List of all imports and dependencies per file/module.
- `references.md`: Map of function/class definitions to their usages.
- `types.md`: Extracted type hints and annotations.
- `control_flow.md`: Overview of control flow constructs found in the codebase.

> Update these files as the codebase evolves or as deeper analysis is performed.
